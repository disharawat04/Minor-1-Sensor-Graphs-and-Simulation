# Minor-1-Sensor-Graphs-and-Simulation
This Unity project demonstrates a simulation environment that models the functionality of an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection. The project uses real-time visualization and graph generation to simulate sensor-based obstacle detection.

Features:

-Ultrasonic Sensor Simulation: Simulates the behavior of an ultrasonic sensor in detecting obstacles at various distances and angles.

-Obstacle Detection: Player character changes path upon detecting obstacles in real-time.

-Time-Series Graph Generation: Visualizes sensor readings dynamically to analyze distance and detection patterns.

-Interactive Environment: Includes a visually engaging Unity scene for testing the simulation.

-No Real Sensor Required: Simulates sensor data without hardware dependency.




Technologies Used:

-Unity Engine: For 3D simulation and visualization.

-C# Scripting: To handle logic, animations, and sensor simulation.

-Graph Visualization: Displays real-time data using Unity UI elements.
